# 6506-Code-2019
UPDATE 4/17/2019:  Due to technical difficulties, problematic development and issues with version control, as well as this code being outdated by several monts, this repository will no longer be updated.  Instead, another repostitory with the revamped code will be created.  The new code will use purely timed robot, as it turns out we were using a combination of different programming styles/frameworks.  The working release from both the Fresno regional and the Monterey Bay regional has been lost due to the afforementioned issues.  :(
